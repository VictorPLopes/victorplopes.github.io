## EARLY WORK-IN-PROGRESS PROJECT

This personal website is where you can find my info and some of [my projects](https://victorplopes.github.io/projects) (related to software, harware and engineering), and see some of the [artwork](https://victorplopes.github.io/artwork) of questionable quality I've created in my spare time. Here you can also find links to my socials and see my [contact info](https://victorplopes.github.io/contact). **Feel free to follow me around and reach out** if you have any questions, opportunities or inquiries, both personal and professional.  

The website was built from scratch by me, using [Angular v20](https://angular.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Sass (SCSS)](https://sass-lang.com/). For some of the components and theming, I used [Angular Material](https://material.angular.dev/). For internalization and localization I am using [Transloco](https://jsverse.gitbook.io/transloco/).

**CURRENTLY ALL DATA (PROJECTS AND ARTWORK) ARE PLACEHOLDERS AND WERE INSERTED FOR TESTING THE LAYOUT.**

### Contributing

If you fork this repository, or copy parts of it for your own public project, you must visibly link back to this repository or my [page](https://victorplopes.github.io/).

## Installation and Setup

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) - v20.19.0 or newer
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/installation) - v21 or newer

### Running a Development Server

After cloning this repository to your machine, open its directory. To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

### Building for Production

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
