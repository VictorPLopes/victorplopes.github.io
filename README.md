## EARLY WORK-IN-PROGRESS PROJECT

This personal website is where you can find my info and some of [my projects](https://victorplopes.github.io/projects) (related to software, harware and engineering), and see some of the [artwork](https://victorplopes.github.io/artwork) of questionable quality I've created in my spare time. Here you can also find links to my socials and see my contact info. **Feel free to follow me around and reach out** if you have any questions, opportunities or inquiries, both personal and professional.  
  
The website was built from scratch by me, using [Angular v20](https://angular.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Sass (SCSS)](https://sass-lang.com/). For some of the components and theming, I used [Angular Material](https://material.angular.dev/). For internalization and localization I am using [Transloco](https://jsverse.gitbook.io/transloco/). The source code of the website is on [GitHub](https://github.com/VictorPLopes/portfolio). **Feel free to make suggestions and contributions**, or fork the repository to use as a template, just please credit me with the proper attribution if you do that.

**CURRENTLY ALL DATA (PROJECTS AND ARTWORK) IS "RANDOM" AND WAS INSERTED FOR TESTING THE LAYOUT.**

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
