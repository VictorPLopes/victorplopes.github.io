          <h2>Hello!</h2>
          <p i18n>
            I am 22 years old Programmer Analyst at
            <a href="https://writesys.com.br/">WriteSys Traffic Systems</a>, where I am a
            <b> full-stack developer </b> and work with C# + .NET, TypeScript + Angular e SQL. I am
            also in my last semester of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. <br /><br />
            I have always been <b>passionate about technology</b> and naturally curious, always
            willing to learn more and explore new innovations and trends. Within this passion, my
            affinity for programming stands out, especially with the C# language and the .NET
            framework, with which I have experience developing Web and Desktop applications. As an
            example,
            <b
              >I worked on the development of a complete web system for managing inventory,
              products, employees, and orders </b
            >. This open-source application, available on
            <a href="https://github.com/VictorPLopes/ITInventorySystem">GitHub</a>, was built with
            <b> REST APIs in C# + ASP.NET and SQL Server on the back-end </b>, and a
            <b> responsive front-end in TypeScript + React and Bootstrap </b>. <br /><br />
            As a hobby, I am also interested in 3D, both 3D art (especially using Blender) and 3D
            printing; both of which I have experience with.

          <h3 i18n>About this website</h3>
          <p i18n>
            This personal website is where you can find my info and some of my projects (related to
            software, harware and engineering), and see some of the artwork of questionable quality
            I've created in my spare time. Here you can also find links to my socials and see my
            contact info. Feel free to follow me around and reach out if you have any questions,
            opportunities or inquiries, both personal and professional.
            <br /><br />
            The website was built from scratch by me, using Angular v20, TypeScript and Sassy CSS.
            For some of the theming and styling, I used Angular Material. For internalization and
            localization I am using Transloco. The source code of the website is on GitHub. Feel
            free to make suggestions and contributions, or fork the repository to use as a template,
            just please credit me with the proper attribution if you do that.
