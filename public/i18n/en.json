  "personal-introduction": "I am 22 years old and a Programmer Analyst at  <a href=\"https://writesys.com.br/\">WriteSys Traffic Systems</a>, where I am a  <b> full-stack developer </b> and work with C# + .NET, TypeScript + Angular e SQL. I am also in my  last semester of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. <br /><br />  I have always been <b>passionate about technology</b> and naturally curious, always willing to  learn more and explore new innovations and trends. Within this passion, my affinity for  programming stands out, especially with the C# language and the .NET framework, with which I have  experience developing Web and Desktop applications. As an example,  <b    >I worked on the development of a complete web system for managing inventory, products,    employees, and orders </b  >. This open-source application, available on  <a href=\"https://github.com/VictorPLopes/ITInventorySystem\">GitHub</a>, was built with  <b> REST APIs in C# + ASP.NET and SQL Server on the back-end </b>, and a  <b> responsive front-end in TypeScript + React and Bootstrap </b>. <br /><br />  As a hobby, I am also interested in 3D, both 3D art (especially using Blender) and 3D printing;  both of which I have experience with.",
